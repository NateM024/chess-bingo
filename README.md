# Chess Bingo 🎯♟️

A two-player game where you play chess and race to complete a bingo card at the same time. Win by **checkmate** — or be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal on your bingo board.

## How to play

1. One player creates a room and chooses a time control
2. Share the 6-character room code (or use the copy link / email invite buttons)
3. The other player enters the code to join
4. Play chess — bingo squares fill in **automatically** as events happen on the board (en passant, knight fork, pawn promotion, etc.)
5. First player to get checkmate **or** complete a bingo line wins
6. After the game, analyse on Lichess or request a rematch (colors swap automatically)

## Bingo events

All 24 events are auto-detected from chess.js move data. Each fires at most once per game. To add or change events, edit the `ALL_EVENTS` array in `public/app.js`:

```js
{
  id: 'knight_fork',
  icon: '♞⑉',
  label: 'Knight\nfork',
  desc: 'A knight attacks two or more valuable pieces',
  detect: (move, gameBefore, gameAfter) => { ... }
}
```

The `detect` function receives the move object, a chess.js instance of the board before the move, and one after. Return `true` to trigger the event.

Current events: kingside castle, queenside castle, pawn promotes, en passant, check, double check, discovered check, any capture, queen trade, bishop pair lost, rook on 7th, back rank check, knight fork, passed pawn, isolated pawn, pawn chain, pawn storm, both knights in endgame, minor takes rook, pawn takes piece, long diagonal, threefold repetition, king captures, pawn on 6th rank.
